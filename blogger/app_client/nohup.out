It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes.

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Computer graphics',
    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer).

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size.

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes.

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Computer graphics',
    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer).

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size.

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Computer graphics',
    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer).

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size.

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Computer graphics',
    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer).

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size.

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Computer graphics',
    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer).

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size.

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Bitmaps',
    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Computer graphics',
    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue?

    blogText: 'You\'ve probably heard of binary, the way that computers represent decimal numbers (1,2,3,4 and so on) using just the two digits zero and one (so the decimal number 5678 becomes 1011000101110 in binary computer speak). Suppose you\'re a computer and you want to remember a picture someone is drawing on your screen. If it\'s in black and white, you could use a zero to store a white area of the picture and a one to store a black area (or vice versa if you prefer). Copying down each pixel in turn, you could transform a picture filling an entire screen of, say, 800 pixels across by 600 pixels down into a list of 480,000 (800 x 600) binary zeros and ones. This way of turning a picture into a computer file made up of binary digits (which are called bits for short) is called a bitmap, because there\'s a direct correspondence—a one-to-one "mapping"—between every pixel in the picture and every bit in the file. In practice, most bitmaps are of colored pictures. If we use a single bit to represent each pixel, we can only tell whether the pixel is on or off (white or black); if we use (say) eight bits to represent each pixel, we could remember eight different colors, but we\'d need eight times more memory (storage space inside the computer) to store a picture the same size. The more colors we want to represent, the more bits we need.',

    blogTitle: 'Aerodynamics: an introduction',
    blogText: 'Have you ever ridden in an open-top car and felt the wind pushing past your face? It\'s exhilarating and you feel really alive, but it\'s also surprising, because we don\'t normally feel the air at all. Although we\'re surrounded by this mysterious gas, and life is impossible without it, we hardly ever give it a moment\'s thought. Understanding how air behaves when we slice through it at speed is incredibly important: without the science of aerodynamics, as it\'s known, we\'d never be able to design planes or spacecraft, land-speed record cars, or bridges that can survive hurricanes. So what exactly is aerodynamics? Let\'s take a closer look!',

    blogTitle: 'Computer graphics',
    blogText: 'Computer graphics means drawing pictures on a computer screen. What\'s so good about that? Sketch something on paper—a man or a house—and what you have is a piece of analog information: the thing you draw is a likeness or analogy of something in the real world. Depending on the materials you use, changing what you draw can be easy or hard: you can erase pencil or charcoal marks easily enough, and you can scrape off oil paints and redo them with no trouble; but altering watercolors or permanent markers is an awful lot more tricky. That\'s the wonder of art, of course—it captures the fresh dash of creativity—and that\'s exactly what we love about it. But where everyday graphics is concerned, the immediacy of art is also a huge drawback. As every sketching child knows too well, if you draw the first part of your picture too big, you\'ll struggle to squeeze everything else on the page.... and what if you change your mind about where to put something or you want to swap red for orange or green for blue? Ever had one of those days where you rip up sheet after sheet of spoiled paper and toss it in the trash?',
